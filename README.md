   # **Tic-Tac-Toe: Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning**

This is a command-line implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a human player competes against an AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with optional **Alpha-Beta pruning** for optimal decision-making.

## üìå **Features**

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Human vs. AI turns on a 3x3 grid.  
- **Smart AI**: Uses Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine the best move.  
- **Reference Guide**: Helps players choose correct input positions.  
- **Performance Comparison**: Compares execution time between basic Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## üïπÔ∏è **How to Play**

1. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   A reference board will display positions (0‚Äì8).

2. A reference board will display positions (0‚Äì8).

3. The human player (O) goes first by entering a number corresponding to the board position.

4. The AI (X) then takes its turn automatically.

5. The game continues until there's a winner or a draw.
