Tic-Tac-Toe: Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning

This is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with optional Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal decision-making.

üìå Features

Interactive Gameplay: Human vs. AI turns on a 3x3 grid.
Smart AI: The AI uses Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine the best possible move.
Reference Guide: Visual guide to help players choose correct input positions.
Performance Comparison: Compares execution time between basic Minimax and optimized Alpha-Beta Pruning.


How to Play

1. Run the script using Python 3:
   python filename.py
  

2. A reference board will display positions (0-8).

3. The human player (O) goes first by entering a number corresponding to the board position.

4. The AI (X) then takes its turn automatically.

5. The game continues until there's a winner or a draw.


Algorithms Used

Minimax: Explores all possible moves to find the optimal outcome.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimized version of Minimax that eliminates unnecessary branches, improving performance.

Performance Example
   Minimax performance:
      Time taken: 0.003214 seconds

   Alpha-Beta Pruning performance:
      Time taken: 0.000976 seconds

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
   Python 3.x
   No external libraries are needed
